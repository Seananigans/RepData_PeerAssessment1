```{r}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("integer","Date","factor"))
data.Rna <- na.omit(data)

```
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(data.Rna)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(data)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
